# Advanced Unix

Most Unix implementations include a large number of powerful tools and utilities. We have just learned the very basics here. We recommend that you use Unix as your main file management tool. It will take time to become comfortable but as you struggle you will finding yourself learning just by looking up solutions on the internet. In this section we superficially cover slightly more advanced topics. The main purpose of the section is to make you aware of what is available rather than explain it detail.

## Arguments

Most Unix commands can be run with arguments. Arguments are typically defined by using a dash `-` or two dashes `--` followed by a letter or a word. An example of an augment is the `-r` in front of `rm`. The `r` stands for recursive and the result is that files and directories are removed recursively meaning that if you type

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
rm -r directory-name
```

all files, subdirectories, file in subdirectories, subdirectories in subdirectories, etc.. will be removed. This is equivalent to throwing a folder in the trash. Except you can't recover it. Once you remove it you remove it. Often when you are removing directories you will encounter files that are protected. For this you use the argument `-f` which stands for `force`. 


You can combine arguments. So for example to remove a directory regardless of protected files you type

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
rm -rf directory-name
```

Now remember, once you remove there is no going back so use this command carefully.

A command is that is often called with argument is `ls`. Here are some examples


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -a 
```
The `a` stands for all. This argument makes `ls` show you all files in the directory including hidden files. In Unix all files starting with a `.` are hidden. Many applications create hidden directories to store important information but without getting in the way of your work. An example is `git`. Once you initialize a  directory as a git directory with `git init` a hidden directory called `.git` is created. Another hidden file is the .gitignore file. 

Another examples is
 
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -l 
```

The `l` stands for long and the result is that more information about the files is shown.


It is often useful to see files in chronological order. For that we use:


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -t 
```

and to reverse the order of how files are shown you can use


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -r 
```

We can combine all these arguments to show more information, for all files, in reverse chronological order:


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -lart 
```

Note that each command has a different set of arguments. In the next section we learn how to find out what they are for each.

## Getting help

As you may have noticed, Unix use an extreme version of abbreviations. This makes it very efficient but hard to guess how to call commands. To make up for this weakness, Unix includes complete help file or _man pages_ (man is short for manual). In most systems you can type `man` followed by the command name to get help. So for `ls` we would type


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
man ls
```

This command is not available in some of the compact implementations of Unix such as Git Bash. An alternative way to get help that works on Git Bash is to type the command followed by `--help`. So for `ls` it would be like this


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls --help
```

## Pipes

The help pages are typically long and if you type of the commands above to see the help it just scrolls all the way to the end. It would be nice to save the help to a file and then use `less` to see it. The `pipe`, written like this `|` does something similar. It _pipes_ the results of a command to the commend after the `pipe`. This is similar to the pipe `%>%` that we use in R. So to get more help we can type


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
man ls | less
```

or in Git Bash


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls --help | less 
```

This is also useful when listing files with many files. we can type


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -lart | less 
```

## Wild cards

One of the most powerful aspects of Unix are the _wild cards_. Suppose we ant to remove all the temporary html files produced during trouble shooting for a project. Imagine there dozens of files. It will be quite painful to remove them one by one. In Unix we can actually write a expression that means all the files that end it `.html`. It uses the wildcards are `*`. To list all html files we would type:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls *.html
```

To remove all html files in a directory we would type


```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm *.html
```

The other useful wild card is the `?` symbol. This means any character. So if all the files we want to erase have the form 
`file-001.html` with the numbers going from 1 to 999, we can type


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
rm file-???.html
```

This will only remove files with that format. 

We can combine wild card. For example to remove all files with the name `file-001` regardless of suffix we can type


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
rm file-???.* 
```


## Environment Variables

Unix has settings that affect your command line _environemnt_. These are called environment variables. The home directory is one of them. We can actually change some of these. In Unix variables are distinguished from other entities by adding a `$` in front. The home directory is stored in `$HOME`

Earlier we saw that `echo` prints out. So we can see our home by typing

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
echo $HOME 
```

You can see them all typing


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
env
```

You can change some of these. But this varies across different _shells_ which we describe next.


## Shells

Much of what we are doing is part of what is called the Unix shell. There are actually different shells. They are very similar, almost noticeable. But there are differences. We do not cover those here. You can see what shell you are using by typing



```{bash, eval=FALSE}
echo $SHELL
```

The most common one is `bash`.

Once you know the shell, you can change environmental variables. In Bash Shell we do is using `export val value`. To change the path, described in more detail soon, like this: (don't actually run this command though!)


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
export PATH = /usr/bin/
```

There is a program that is run before each terminal starts where you can edit variables so they change whenever you call the terminal. This changes in different implementations but if using bash you can create a file called   `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`,`.bash_login`, or `.profile`. You might already have one. 


## Executibles

In Unix all programs are files. They are called executives. So `ls`, `mv` and `git` are all files. But where are these program files? You can find out using the command `which`


```{bash}
which git
```

That directory is probably full of program files. The directory `/usr/bin` usually holds many program files. If you type

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls /usr/bin
```

in your terminal you will see several executable files.

There are other directories that usually hold program files. The Application directory in the MAC or Program Files directory in Windows are examples.

Note that when you type `ls`, Unix knows to go run a program in another directory. How does it know this? This information is included in the environmental variable `$PATH`. If you type


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
echo $PATH
```

you will see a list of directories separated by `:`. The directory `/usr/bin` is probably one of the first ones on the list.
Unix looks for program files in those directories in that order. Although we don't teach it here, you can actually create executbles yourself. But if you put it in your working directory and this directory is not on the path you can't run it just by typing the command. You get around this by typing the full path. So if your command is called my-ls you can type


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
./my-ls
```

Learning to write your own executibles is useful. 

## Permissions and file types

If you type 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -l
```

At the begging you will see a series of symbols like this `-rw-r--r--`. This string indicates the type of file each file is: regular file `-`, directory `d`, or executable `x`. This string also indicates the permission of the file: is it readable? is it writable? is it execrable? Can other users on the system read? Can other users of the system write? Can other users execute if the file is executable? This more advanced that what we cover here but you can learn much more in a Unix reference book.

## Commands you should learn

There are many commands that are beyond the scope of this book but we want to make you aware of them. They are 

- open/start - On the mac `open filename` tries to figure out the right application of the filename and open it with that application. This is a very useful command. On Git Bash you can try `start filename`. Try opening an `R` or `Rmd` file with `open` or `start`: it should open them with RStudio.

- nano - A bare-bones editor.

- ln - create a symbolic link. We do not recommend its use but you should know about it.

- tar - archive files and subdirectories of a directory into one file.

- ssh - connect to another computer.

- grep - search for patterns in a file.

- awk/sed - These are two very powerful commands that permit you to find specific strings in files and change them.


## File manipulation in R

We can also perform file management form within R. The key functions to learn about can be seen by looking at the help file for 
`?files`. Another useful function is `unlink`.

Although not recommended, note that you can run Unix commands in R using `system`.
