# Probability 

Because knowing how to compute probabilities gives you an edge in games of chance, throughout history many smart individuals, including famous mathematicians such as Cardano, Fermat and Pascal, spent time and energy thinking through the math of these games. As a result, Probability Theory was born. Probability continues to be highly useful in modern games of chance. For example, in poker, we can compute the probability of winning a hand based on the cards on the table. Also, casinos rely on probability theory to develop games that almost certainly guarantee a profit. 
Probability theory is useful in many other contexts and, in particular, in areas that depend on data affected by chance in some way. Knowledge of probability is therefore indispensable for data science.

In games of chance, probability has a very intuitive definition. For instance, we know what it means that the chance of a pair of dice coming up seven is 1 in 6. However, this is not the case in other contexts. Today probability theory is being used much more broadly with the word _probability_ commonly used in everyday language. Google's auto-complete of "What are the chances of" give us: "having twins", "rain today", "getting struck by lightning", and "getting cancer". 

One of the motivating examples for this chapter is the [financial crisis of 2007-2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308). This financial crisis was in part caused by underestimating the risk of certain [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)) sold by financial institutions. Specifically, the risk of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) were grossly underestimated. These assets were sold at prices that assumed most homeowners would make their monthly payments, and the probability of this not occurring was calculated as being low. A combination of factors resulted in many more defaults than were expected, which led to a price crash of these securities. As a consequence, banks lost so much money that they needed government bailouts to avoid closing down completely.

To begin to comprehend this very complicated event, we need to understand the basics of probability. We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. Before using probability concepts to understand our motivating example,  we will use several examples related to games of chance since these are simple and illustrative.
