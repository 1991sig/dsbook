# Recommendation systems

Recommendation systems use ratings that _users_ have given _items_ to make specific recommendations to users. Companies like Amazon, that sell many products to many customers and permit these customers to rate their products, are able to collect massive datasets that can be used to predict what rating a particular user will give a specific item. Items for which a high rating is predicted for a given user are then recommended to that user. 

Netflix uses a recommendation system to predict how many _stars_ a user will give a specific movie. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ml/img/netflix.png")
```

Here we provide the basics of how these recommendations are predicted, motivated by some of the approaches taken by the winners of the  _Netflix challenges_.  On October 2006, Netflix offered a challenge to the data science community: improve our recommendation algorithm by 10% and win a million dollars. In September 2009, 
[the winners were announced](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/21/netflix-awards-1-million-prize-and-starts-a-new-contest/). You can read a good summary of how the winning algorithm was put together [here](http://blog.echen.me/2011/10/24/winning-the-netflix-prize-a-summary/) 
and a more detailed explanation [here](http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BellKor.pdf). Here we show you some of the data analysis strategies used by the winning team.

## Movielens data

The Netflix data is not publicly available, but the [GroupLens research lab](https://grouplens.org/) generated their own database with over 20 million ratings for over 27,000 movies by more than 138,000 users. We make a small subset of this data available via the dslabs package:

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data("movielens")
```

We can see this table is in tidy format with thousands of rows:

```{r}
head(movielens)
```

Each row represents a rating given by one user to one movie. 

We can see the number of unique users that provided ratings and for how many unique movies they provided them for:


```{r}
movielens %>% 
  summarize(n_users = n_distinct(userId),
            n_movies = n_distinct(movieId))
```

If we multiply those two numbers, we get a number larger than 5 million, yet our data table has about 100,000 rows. This implies that not every user rated every movie. So we can think of these data as a very large matrix, with users on the rows and movies on the columns, with many empty cells. The `gather` function permits us to convert it to this format, but if we try it for the entire matrix, it will crash R. Let's show the matrix for a few users:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
keep <- movielens %>% 
  count(movieId) %>% 
  top_n(5, n) %>% 
  .$movieId

tab <- movielens %>% 
  filter(movieId%in%keep) %>% 
  filter(userId %in% c(13:20)) %>% 
  select(userId, title, rating) %>% 
  spread(title, rating)

tab %>% knitr::kable()
```

You can think of the task of a recommendation system as filling in the `NA`s in the table above. To see how _sparse_ the matrix is, here is the matrix for a random sample of 100 movies and 100 users with yellow indicating a user/movie combination for which we have a rating.

```{r sparsity-of-movie-recs, echo=FALSE}
users <- sample(unique(movielens$userId), 100)
rafalib::mypar()
movielens %>% filter(userId %in% users) %>% 
  select(userId, movieId, rating) %>%
  mutate(rating = 1) %>%
  spread(movieId, rating) %>% select(sample(ncol(.), 100)) %>% 
  as.matrix() %>% t(.) %>%
  image(1:100, 1:100,. , xlab="Movies", ylab="Users")
  abline(h=0:100+0.5, v=0:100+0.5, col = "grey")
```

This machine learning challenge is more complicated than what we have studied up to now because each outcome $Y$ has a different set of predictors. To see this, note that if we are predicting the rating for movie $i$ by user $u$, in principle, all other ratings related to movie $i$ and by user $u$ may used as predictors, but different users rate a different number of movies and different movies. Furthermore, we may be able to use information from other movies that we have determined are similar to movie $i$ or from users determined to be similar to user $u$. So, in essence, the entire matrix can be used as predictors for each cell. 

Let's look at some of the general properties of the data to better understand the challenges.

The first thing we notice is that some movies get rated more than others. Here is the distribution:

```{r movie-id-hist}
movielens %>% 
  count(movieId) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, color = "black") + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  ggtitle("Movies")
```

This should not surprise us given that there are blockbuster movies watched by millions and artsy, independent movies watched by just a few. 

Our second observation is that some users are more active than others at rating movies:

```{r movie-user-hist}
movielens %>% 
  count(userId) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, color = "black") + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  ggtitle("Users")
```


## Recommendation systems as a machine learning challenge

To see how this is a type of machine learning, notice that we need to build an algorithm with data we have collected that will then be applied outside our control, as users look for movie recommendations. So let's create a test set to assess the accuracy of the models we implement.

```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(755)
test_index <- createDataPartition(y = movielens$rating, times = 1, p = 0.2, list = FALSE)
train_set <- movielens[-test_index,]
test_set <- movielens[test_index,]
```

To make sure we don't include users and movies in the test set that do not appear in the training set, we remove these entries using the `semi_join` function:

```{r}
test_set <- test_set %>% 
  semi_join(train_set, by = "movieId") %>%
  semi_join(train_set, by = "userId")
```


### Loss function 

The Netflix challenge used the typical error loss and thus decided on a winner based on the residual mean squared error (RMSE) on a test set. [AN: review following sentences] We define $y_{u,i}$ as the rating for movie $i$ by user $u$ and $\hat{y}_{i,u}$ as our prediction. The RMSE is defined as: 

$$
\mbox{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{u,i}^{} \left( \hat{y}_{u,i} - y_{u,i} \right)^2 }
$$
with $N$ being the number of user/movie combinations and the sum occurring over all these combinations.

Remember that we can interpret the RMSE similarly to a standard deviation: it is the typical error we make when predicting a movie rating. If this number is larger than 1, we are typically missing [AN: missing what?] by one star rating which is not good.

Let's write a function that computes the RMSE for vectors of ratings and their corresponding predictors:

```{r}
RMSE <- function(true_ratings, predicted_ratings){
    sqrt(mean((true_ratings - predicted_ratings)^2))
  }
```

### A first model

Let's start by building the simplest possible recommendation system: we predict the same rating for all movies regardless of user. So what number should this prediction be? We can use a model based approach. A model that assume the same rating for all movies and users with all the differences explained by random variation would look like this:


$$
Y_{u,i} = \mu + \varepsilon_{u,i}
$$

with $\varepsilon_{i}$ independent errors sampled from the same distribution centered at 0 and $\mu$ the "true" rating for all movies. We know that the estimate that minimizes the RMSE is the least squares estimate of $\mu$ and, in this case, is the average of all ratings:

```{r}
mu_hat <- mean(train_set$rating)
mu_hat
```

If we predict all unknown ratings with $\hat{\mu}$ or `mu` above, we obtain the following RMSE: 

```{r}
naive_rmse <- RMSE(test_set$rating, mu_hat)
naive_rmse
```

Keep in mind that if you plug in any other number, you get a higher RMSE. For example:

```{r}
predictions <- rep(2.5, nrow(test_set))
RMSE(test_set$rating, predictions)
```


From looking at the distribution of ratings, we can visualize that this is the standard deviation of that distribution. We get a RMSE of about 1. To win the grand prize of $1,000,000, a participating team had to get an RMSE of about 0.857. So we can definitely do better! 

As we go along, we will be comparing different approaches. Let's start by creating a results table with this naive approach:

```{r}
rmse_results <- data_frame(method = "Just the average", RMSE = naive_rmse)
```

## Modeling movie effects

We know from experience that some movies are just generally rated higher than others. 

So our intuition that different movies are rated differently is confirmed by data. So we can augment our previous model by adding the term $b_i$ to represent average ranking for movie $i$: 

$$
Y_{u,i} = \mu + b_i + \varepsilon_{u,i}
$$

In statistics, we usually call the $b$s as effects, but in 
the Netflix challenge papers, they refer to them as "bias", thus the $b$ notation.

We can again use least squared to estimate the $b_i$ in the following way:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fit <- lm(rating ~ as.factor(userId), data = movielens)
```

Because there are thousands of $b_i$, each movie gets one, the `lm()` function will be very slow here. We therefore don't recommend running the code above. However, in this particular situation, we know that the least square estimate $\hat{b}_i$ is just the average of $Y_{u,i} - \hat{\mu}$ for each movie $i$. So we can compute them this way (we will drop the `hat` notation in the code to represent estimates going forward):

```{r}
mu <- mean(train_set$rating) 
movie_avgs <- train_set %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(b_i = mean(rating - mu))
```

We can see that these estimates vary substantially:

```{r movie-effects}
movie_avgs %>% qplot(b_i, geom ="histogram", bins = 10, data = ., color = I("black"))
```

Remember $\hat{\mu}=3.5$ so a $b_i = 1.5$ implies a perfect five star rating.

Let's see how much our prediction improves once we predict using $\hat{y}_{u,i} = \hat{\mu} + \hat{b}_i$:

```{r}
predicted_ratings <- mu + test_set %>% 
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  .$b_i

model_1_rmse <- RMSE(predicted_ratings, test_set$rating)
rmse_results <- bind_rows(rmse_results,
                          data_frame(method="Movie Effect Model",  
                                     RMSE = model_1_rmse ))
rmse_results %>% knitr::kable()
```

We already see an improvement. But can we make it better?

### User effects

Let's compute the average rating for user $u$, for those that have rated over 100 movies. 

```{r user-effect-hist}
train_set %>% 
  group_by(userId) %>% 
  summarize(b_u = mean(rating)) %>% 
  filter(n()>=100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(b_u)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, color = "black")
```

Notice that there is substantial variability across users 
as well: some users are very cranky and others love every movie.
This implies that a further improvement to our model may be:

$$ 
Y_{u,i} = \mu + b_i + b_u + \varepsilon_{u,i}
$$

where $b_u$ is a user-specific effect. So now if a cranky user (negative $b_u$) rates a great movie (positive $b_i$), the effects counter each other and we may be able to correctly predict that this user gave this great movie a 3 rather than a 5. 

To fit this model, we could again use `lm`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lm(rating ~ as.factor(movieId) + as.factor(userId))
```

but again we won't. Instead, we will compute an approximation but computing $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{b}_i$ and estimating $\hat{b}_u$ as the average of $y_{u,i} - \hat{\mu} - \hat{b}_i$

```{r}
user_avgs <- test_set %>% 
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  group_by(userId) %>%
  summarize(b_u = mean(rating - mu - b_i))
```

We can now construct predictors and see how much the RMSE improves:

```{r}
predicted_ratings <- test_set %>% 
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  left_join(user_avgs, by='userId') %>%
  mutate(pred = mu + b_i + b_u) %>%
  .$pred


model_2_rmse <- RMSE(predicted_ratings, test_set$rating)
rmse_results <- bind_rows(rmse_results,
                          data_frame(method="Movie + User Effects Model",  
                                     RMSE = model_2_rmse ))
rmse_results %>% knitr::kable()
```

# Regularization

Despite the large movie to movie variation our improvement in RMSE was only about 5%. Let's explore where we made mistakes in our first model (using only movies). Here are the 10 largest mistakes:


```{r}
test_set %>% 
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  mutate(residual = rating - (mu + b_i)) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(residual))) %>% 
  select(title,  residual) %>% slice(1:10) %>% knitr::kable()
```

These all seem like obscure movies. Many of them have large predictions. Let's look at the top 10 worst and best movies based on $\hat{b}_i$. First, let's create a database that connects `movieId` to movie title:

```{r}
movie_titles <- movielens %>% 
  select(movieId, title) %>%
  distinct()
```

Here are the best 10 movies according to our estimate:

```{r}
movie_avgs %>% left_join(movie_titles, by="movieId") %>%
  arrange(desc(b_i)) %>% 
  select(title, b_i) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>%  
  knitr::kable()
```

And here are the worst 10:

```{r}
movie_avgs %>% left_join(movie_titles, by="movieId") %>%
  arrange(b_i) %>% 
  select(title, b_i) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>%  
  knitr::kable()
```

They all seem to be quite obscure. Let's look at how often they are rated.

```{r}
train_set %>% count(movieId) %>% 
  left_join(movie_avgs) %>%
  left_join(movie_titles, by="movieId") %>%
  arrange(desc(b_i)) %>% 
  select(title, b_i, n) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

train_set %>% count(movieId) %>% 
  left_join(movie_avgs) %>%
  left_join(movie_titles, by="movieId") %>%
  arrange(b_i) %>% 
  select(title, b_i, n) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

The supposed "best" and "worst" movies were rated by very few users, in most cases just 1. These movies were mostly obscure ones. This is because with just a few users, we have more uncertainty. Therefore, larger estimates of $b_i$, negative or positive, are more likely. 

These are noisy estimates that we should not trust, 
especially when it comes to prediction. Large errors can 
increase our RMSE, so we would rather be conservative
when unsure.

In previous sections, we computed standard error and constructed confidence intervals to account for different levels of uncertainty. However, when making predictions we need one number, one prediction, not an interval. For this we introduce the concept of regularization.

Regularization permits us to penalize large estimates that 
come from small sample sizes. It has commonalities with the 
Bayesian approach that shrunk predictions. The general 
idea is to add a penalty for large values of $b_i$ to the sum of squares equation that we minimize. So having many large $b_i$ makes it harder to minimize.

One way to think about this is that if we were to fit an effect to every rating, we could, of course, make the sum of squares equation by simply making each $b$ match its respective rating $Y$. This would yield an unstable estimate that changes drastically with new instances of $Y$. Remember that $Y$ is a random variable. By penalizing the equation, we optimize to be bigger when the estimated $b$ are far from 0; we then shrink the estimate towards 0. This is similar to the Bayesian approach we saw earlier.

To estimate the $b_i$ we now minimize this equation:

$$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{u,i} \left(y_{u,i} - \mu - b_i\right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{i} b_i^2$$
The first term is just least squares and the second is a penalty that gets larger when many $b_i$ are large. Using calculus we can actually show that the values of $b_i$ that minimize this equation are:

$$
\hat{b}_i(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\lambda + n_i} \sum_{u=1}^{n_i} \left(Y_{u,i} - \hat{\mu}\right)
$$

where $n_i$ is the number of ratings made for movie $i$.

This approach will have our desired effect: when $n_i$ is very large, which will give us a stable estimate, then $\lambda$ is effectively ignored since $n_i+\lambda \approx n_i$. However, when $n_i$ is small, then the estimate $\hat{b}_i(\lambda)$ is shrunken towards 0. The larger $\lambda$, the more we shrink.

Let's compute these regularized estimates of $b_i$ using 
$\lambda=3$. Later, we will see why we picked 3. 

```{r}
lambda <- 3
mu <- mean(train_set$rating)
movie_reg_avgs <- train_set %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(b_i = sum(rating - mu)/(n()+lambda), n_i = n()) 
```

To see how the estimates shrink, let's make a plot of the regularized estimates versus the least squares estimates.

```{r regularization-shrinkage}
data_frame(original = movie_avgs$b_i, 
           regularlized = movie_reg_avgs$b_i, 
           n = movie_reg_avgs$n_i) %>%
    ggplot(aes(original, regularlized, size=sqrt(n))) + 
        geom_point(shape=1, alpha=0.5)
```

Let's look at the top 10 best movies based on $\hat{b}_i(\lambda)$:

```{r}
train_set %>%
  count(movieId) %>% 
  left_join(movie_reg_avgs) %>%
  left_join(movie_titles, by="movieId") %>%
  arrange(desc(b_i)) %>% 
  select(title, b_i, n) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

These make much more sense! Here are the top 10 worst movies:

```{r}
train_set %>%
  count(movieId) %>% 
  left_join(movie_reg_avgs) %>%
  left_join(movie_titles, by="movieId") %>%
  arrange(b_i) %>% 
  select(title, b_i, n) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Do we improve our results?

```{r}
predicted_ratings <- test_set %>% 
  left_join(movie_reg_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  mutate(pred = mu + b_i) %>%
  .$pred

model_3_rmse <- RMSE(predicted_ratings, test_set$rating)
rmse_results <- bind_rows(rmse_results,
                          data_frame(method="Regularized Movie Effect Model",  
                                     RMSE = model_2_rmse ))
rmse_results %>% knitr::kable()
```

This provides a very large improvement. 

Note that $\lambda is a tuning parameter. We can use cross-validation to chose it.

```{r best-penalty}
lambdas <- seq(0, 10, 0.25)

mu <- mean(train_set$rating)
just_the_sum <- train_set %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>% 
  summarize(s = sum(rating - mu), n_i = n())

rmses <- sapply(lambdas, function(l){
  predicted_ratings <- test_set %>% 
    left_join(just_the_sum, by='movieId') %>% 
    mutate(b_i = s/(n_i+l)) %>%
    mutate(pred = mu + b_i) %>%
    .$pred
  return(RMSE(predicted_ratings, test_set$rating))
})
qplot(lambdas, rmses)  
lambdas[which.min(rmses)]
```

However, while we show this as an illustration, in practice we should be using full cross validation just on the train set, without using the test set until the final assessment.

We can use regularization for the estimate user effects as well. We are minimizing:

$$
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{u,i} \left(y_{i,u} - \mu - b_i - b_u \right)^2 + 
\lambda \left(\sum_{i} b_i^2 + \sum_{u} b_u^2\right)
$$

The estimates that minimize this can be found similarly to what we did above. Here we use cross-validation to pick a $\lambda$:

```{r best-lambdas}
lambdas <- seq(0, 10, 0.25)

rmses <- sapply(lambdas, function(l){

  mu <- mean(train_set$rating)
  
  b_i <- train_set %>% 
    group_by(movieId) %>%
    summarize(b_i = sum(rating - mu)/(n()+l))
  
  b_u <- train_set %>% 
    left_join(b_i, by="movieId") %>%
    group_by(userId) %>%
    summarize(b_u = sum(rating - b_i - mu)/(n()+l))

  predicted_ratings <- 
    test_set %>% 
    left_join(b_i, by = "movieId") %>%
    left_join(b_u, by = "userId") %>%
    mutate(pred = mu + b_i + b_u) %>%
    .$pred
  
    return(RMSE(predicted_ratings, test_set$rating))
})

qplot(lambdas, rmses)  
```

For the full model, the optimal $\lambda$ is:

```{r}
lambda <- lambdas[which.min(rmses)]
lambda
```


```{r}
rmse_results <- bind_rows(rmse_results,
                          data_frame(method="Regularized Movie + User Effect Model",  
                                     RMSE = min(rmses)))
rmse_results %>% knitr::kable()

```

# Matrix Factorization

Matrix factorization is a widely used concept in machine learning. It is very much related to factor analysis, singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA). Here we describe the concept in the context of movie recommendation systems.

We have described how the model:

$$ 
Y_{u,i} = \mu + b_i + b_u + \varepsilon_{u,i}
$$

which accounts for movie to movie differences through the $b_i$ and user to user differences through the $b_u$. But this model leaves out an important source of variation related to the fact that groups of movies have similar rating patterns and groups of users have similar rating patterns as well. We will discover these patterns by studying the residuals:

$$
r_{u,i} = y_{u,i} - \hat{b}_i - \hat{b}_u
$$

To see this, we will convert the data into a matrix so that each user gets a row and each movie gets a column so that $y_{u,i}$ is the entry in row $u$ and column $i$. For illustrative purposes, we will only consider a small subset of movies with many ratings and users that have rated many movies:

```{r}
train_small <- movielens %>% 
  group_by(movieId) %>%
  filter(n() >= 50 | movieId == 3252) %>% ungroup() %>% #3252 is Scent of a Woman used in example
  group_by(userId) %>%
  filter(n() >= 50) %>% ungroup()

y <- train_small %>% 
  select(userId, movieId, rating) %>%
  spread(movieId, rating) %>%
  as.matrix()
```

We add row names and column names:

```{r}
rownames(y)<- y[,1]
y <- y[,-1]

colnames(y) <- with(movie_titles, title[match(colnames(y), movieId)])
```

and convert them to residuals by removing the column and row effects:

```{r}
y <- sweep(y, 1, rowMeans(y, na.rm=TRUE))
y <- sweep(y, 2, colMeans(y, na.rm=TRUE))
```

If the model above explains all the signal, and the $\varepsilon$ are just noise, then the residuals for different movies should be independent from each other. But they are not. Here is an example:

```{r godfathers-cor}
m_1 <- "Godfather, The"
m_2 <- "Godfather: Part II, The"
qplot(y[ ,m_1], y[,m_2], xlab = m_1, ylab = m_2)
```

This plot says that users that liked The Godfather more than what the model expects them to, based on the movie and user effect, also liked The Godfather II more than expected. [AN: check next sent. not sure of use of The Godfather again. Did you mean: Those who liked the Godfather were also going to be predicted to like Goodfellas?] The same is true for The Godfather and Goodfellas:

```{r godfather-goodfellas-cor}
m_1 <- "Godfather, The"
m_3 <- "Goodfellas"
qplot(y[ ,m_1], y[,m_3], xlab = m_1, ylab = m_3)
```

Although not as strong, there is still correlation. We see correlations between other movies as well:

```{r got-mail-sleepless-in-sea-cor}
m_4 <- "You've Got Mail" 
m_5 <- "Sleepless in Seattle" 
qplot(y[ ,m_4], y[,m_5], xlab = m_4, ylab = m_5)
```

We can see a pattern:

```{r}
cor(y[, c(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5)], use="pairwise.complete") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

There seems to be people that like romantic comedies more than expected, while others that like gangster movies more than expected.

These results tell us that there is structure in the data. But how can we model this?

## Factors

Here is an illustration of how we can use some structure to predict the $r_{u,i}$. Suppose our residuals look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
options(digits = 2)
Q <- matrix(c(1 , 1, 1, -1, -1), ncol=1)
rownames(Q) <- c(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5)
P <- matrix(rep(c(2,0,-2), c(3,5,4)), ncol=1)
rownames(P) <- 1:nrow(P)

X <- jitter(P%*%t(Q))
X %>% knitr::kable(align = "c")
```

There seems to be pattern here. In fact, we can see very strong correlation patterns:

```{r}
cor(X)
```

The structure seems to be explained by these coefficients:

```{r}
t(Q) %>% knitr::kable(aling="c")
```

Note that here we can narrow down movies to two groups: gangster and romance. We can also reduce the users to three groups. 

```{r}
P
```

Those that like gangster movies, but hate romance ones, the reverse, and those that don't care. [AN: check following sentences. One needs to be deleted] The main point here is that we can reconstruct this data with 60 value with a couple of vectors totaling 17 values:


We can model the 60 residuals with this 17 parameter model:

$$
r_{u,i} \approx p_u q_i 
$$

And we should be able to explain much more of the variance:

$$
Y_{u,i} = \mu + b_i + b_u + p_u q_i + \varepsilon_{i,j}
$$

Now the structure in our movie data seems to be much more complicated than gangster movie versus romance. We may have other factors. For example, we may have:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
options(digits = 2)
m_6 <- "Scent of a Woman"
Q <- cbind(c(1 , 1, 1, -1, -1, -1), 
           c(1 , 1, -1, -1, -1, 1))
rownames(Q) <- c(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, m_6)
P <- cbind(rep(c(2,0,-2), c(3,5,4)), 
          c(-1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,-1,-1,-1))/2
rownames(P) <- 1:nrow(X)

X <- jitter(P%*%t(Q), factor=1)
X %>% knitr::kable(align = "c")
```

Now we see another factor: love, hates, or doesn't care about Al Pacino. The correlation is a bit more complicated now.

```{r}
cor(X)
```

Now to explain the structure we need two factors:

```{r}
t(Q) %>% knitr::kable(aling="c")
```

And two sets of coefficients:

```{r}
P
```

The model now has more parameters but still less than the original data. So we should be able to fit this:

$$
Y_{u,i} = \mu + b_i + b_u + p_{u,1} q_{1,i} + p_{u,2} q_{2,i} + \varepsilon_{i,j}
$$

[AN: check next sent] For the Netflix regularization was also used to fit penalize for large values of $p$ and $q$.

Here are the actual correlations:

```{r}
six_movies <- c(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, m_6)
tmp <- y[,six_movies]
cor(tmp, use="pairwise.complete")
```

## Connetion to SVD and PCA

The decomposition:

$$
r_{u,i} \approx p_{u,1} q_{1,i} + p_{u,2} q_{2,i}
$$

is very much related to SVD and PCA. SVD and PCA are complicated concepts, but one way to understand them is that SVD is an algorithm that finds the vectors $p$ and $q$ that permit us to rewrite the matrix $\mbox{r}$ with $m$ rows and $n$ columns as:

$$
r_{u,i} = p_{u,1} q_{1,i} + p_{u,2} q_{2,i} + \dots + p_{u,m} q_{m,i} 
$$

with the variability of each term decreasing and with the $p$s uncorrelated. The algorithm also computes this variability so that we can know how much of the matrices total variability is explained as we add new terms. This may permit us to see that, with just a few terms, we can explain most of the variability.

Let's see an example with the movie data. To compute the decomposition we will make the NAs 0:

```{r}
y[is.na(y)] <- 0
y <- sweep(y, 1, rowMeans(y))
pca <- prcomp(y)
```

The $q$ vectors are called the principal components and they are stored in this matrix:

```{r}
dim(pca$rotation)
```

While the $p$, or the user effects, are here:

```{r}
dim(pca$x)
```

We can see the variability of each of the vectors:

```{r, pca-sds}
plot(pca$sdev)
```

and see that just the first few already explain a large percent:

```{r var-expained-pca}
var_explained <- cumsum(pca$sdev^2/sum(pca$sdev^2))
plot(var_explained)
```

We also notice that the PC that are estimate [AN: estimates? estimated?] are related to the structure in opinions about movies:

```{r movies-pca}
library(ggrepel)

pcs <- data.frame(pca$rotation, name = colnames(y))

pcs %>%  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(PC1, PC2, label=name),
                  data = filter(pcs, 
                                PC1 < -0.1 | PC1 > 0.1 | PC2 < -0.075 | PC2 > 0.1))
```

Just by looking at the top three in each direction, we see a meaningful pattern. The first PC shows the difference between critically acclaimed movies on one side:

```{r}
pcs %>% select(name, PC1) %>% arrange(PC1) %>% slice(1:10)
```

and Hollywood blockbusters on the other:

```{r}
pcs %>% select(name, PC1) %>% arrange(desc(PC1)) %>% slice(1:10)
```

While the second PC seems to go from artsy, independent films:

```{r}
pcs %>% select(name, PC2) %>% arrange(PC2) %>% slice(1:10)
```

to nerd favorites:

```{r}
pcs %>% select(name, PC2) %>% arrange(desc(PC2)) %>% slice(1:10)
```

Fitting a model that incorporates these estimates into [AN: into what?] is complicated. For those interested, we recommend trying the `recommenderlab` package and do not get into the details here [AN: fix this last sent].
